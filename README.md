# Custom Updater

_A component which allows you to track and update custom cards/components and python_scripts._ 

## Partial deprecation.

Continued development for this custom_component have now come to a stop.
There will be no new features added to this, and only blocking major issues will be fixed.
The service that generates the json files [here](https://github.com/custom-cards/information/blob/master/repos.json) and [here](https://github.com/custom-components/information/blob/master/repos.json) will shut down later 2019 or early 2020 (more details will be posted later.)

Why?, you can read most of my issues with it here https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater/issues/117

What now? [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)  
HACS are not a full replacement, but it replaces most of the functionality and support, and then some, check it out :)
